#### Working Basics

The ideal resin exposure test is a continuous UV exposure that hides columns at each defined interval. This video like method allows for the quickest and most reliable results
For this test to resul the printer must support at least one of the following modes

**Historical context**

This test method is not new, the most common name it goes by is step wedge.

The first time I was *exposed* (pun intended) to this method was in highschool with darkroom photography revelation (video here)
Later during my professional life Iworked with a similar method in silkscreen printing and soon after joining altLabs hackerspace PCB
